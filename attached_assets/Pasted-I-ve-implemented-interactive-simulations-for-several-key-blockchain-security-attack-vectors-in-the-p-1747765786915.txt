I've implemented interactive simulations for several key blockchain security attack vectors in the presentation. Here's a detailed overview of the attacks and their interactive simulations:

1. Reentrancy Attack
Simulation Details:

Interactive visualization showing how a malicious contract can re-enter a vulnerable function before state is updated
Step-by-step animation of the attack process with execution stack display
Live balance tracking showing how funds are drained
Interactive buttons to trigger and reset the simulation
What It Demonstrates:
The simulation shows how a vulnerable withdrawal function can be exploited when it sends ETH before updating balances, allowing attackers to repeatedly withdraw funds before the balance is set to zero.

2. NoContract Modifier Protection
Simulation Details:

Interactive terminal-style interface showing transaction logs
Two simulation buttons: legitimate user transaction vs. malicious contract transaction
Visual indicators showing how the security mechanism blocks contract-based attacks
What It Demonstrates:
This simulation shows how the NoContract modifier (checking if tx.origin equals msg.sender) prevents contract-based attacks by blocking any transactions that come from contracts rather than direct user accounts.

3. Centralization vs. Decentralization Attack Resistance
Simulation Details:

Side-by-side network visualizations (centralized vs. decentralized)
Interactive attack buttons to simulate network attacks
Visual feedback showing how centralized systems fail while decentralized systems adapt
What It Demonstrates:
Shows how centralized systems have a single point of failure that can bring down the entire network, while decentralized systems continue functioning even when multiple nodes are compromised.

4. DoS (Denial of Service) Attack Protection
Simulation Details:

Side-by-side comparison of vulnerable "push" pattern vs. secure "pull" pattern
Illustrates how loops in contracts can hit gas limits or be exploited
Demonstrates the pull-over-push pattern as a solution
What It Demonstrates:
Shows how traditional approaches to distributing funds to multiple recipients can be vulnerable to DoS attacks, and how implementing a pull pattern (where recipients withdraw their own funds) provides protection.

5. Checks-Effects-Interactions (CEI) Pattern
Simulation Details:

Interactive step-by-step flow showing the correct order of operations
Side-by-side code comparison between vulnerable and secure implementations
Tabbed interface showing principles, comparisons, and implementation details
What It Demonstrates:
Illustrates the importance of following the CEI pattern (performing checks first, then updating state, and only then making external calls) to prevent reentrancy and other attacks.

Each of these simulations provides an interactive, visual way to understand the security concepts rather than just reading about them. They allow users to see both the vulnerable implementations and the secure solutions to better understand blockchain security principles.
