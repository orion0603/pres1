Audit Results: Before Page
The "Audit Results: Before" page showcases the initial security audit findings before implementing blockchain security measures.

Design Elements:

Terminal Interface: Uses a dark terminal-like design with console output to simulate a security audit tool (like Slither)
Error Highlighting: Red text highlights critical vulnerabilities
Vulnerability Count: Shows "4 VULNERABILITIES DETECTED" prominently
Risk Level Indicators: Visual display of high, medium, and low risk findings
Vulnerability List: Details each vulnerability with severity level:
Reentrancy vulnerability (High risk)
Unchecked external call (Medium risk)
Incorrect CEI pattern implementation (Medium risk)
Integer overflow in donation tracking (Low risk)
The design creates a sense of urgency with its error-focused red text and clear categorization of issues. It mimics what security auditors would see when analyzing the initial smart contract code.

Audit Results: After Page
The "Audit Results: After" page demonstrates the improved contract after implementing all the security measures covered in the presentation.

Design Elements:

Terminal Interface: Maintains the terminal aesthetic for consistency
Success Highlighting: Green text indicates resolved issues
Zero Vulnerabilities: Prominently displays "0 VULNERABILITIES DETECTED"
Checkmarks: Visual checkmarks (✓) next to each resolved issue
Solution Overview: Lists the specific security measures implemented:
Reentrancy mitigated with noReentrant modifier
External calls properly checked
CEI pattern implemented correctly
SafeMath used to prevent overflows
Success Message: Includes a "Contract ready for deployment" recommendation
Visual Improvements: Includes a celebratory success icon and color scheme
The design uses green success indicators and checkmarks to create a visual contrast with the "before" page, highlighting the transformation from vulnerable to secure code after implementing the security measures discussed throughout the presentation.

Both pages work together to tell a compelling before-and-after story, demonstrating the effectiveness of the security measures when properly implemented. They also reinforce the presentation's educational goals by visually summarizing the security improvements covered in earlier sections.

I'll explain the "Audit Results: After" page design in more detail:

Audit Results: After Page
The "Audit Results: After" page is designed to showcase the successful implementation of security measures and the resolution of all vulnerabilities that were identified in the initial audit.

Design Elements and Layout:

Terminal Interface Design:

Maintains a consistent terminal-style aesthetic with the "Before" page
Features a dark background with monospaced text
Includes decorative terminal window controls (red, yellow, green dots) at the top
Success Color Scheme:

Uses teal/green color (#57FFB4) as the primary accent color
Success messages and checkmarks are highlighted in green
Creates a strong visual contrast with the red error messages from the "Before" page
Terminal Header:

Shows "Terminal - Slither Analysis" to indicate this is the same analysis tool
Maintains consistent styling with the "Before" page for easy comparison
Console Output:

Begins with a command prompt showing $ slither BadirDonation.sol
Features prominent "0 VULNERABILITIES DETECTED" message in green
Lists all previously detected issues with green checkmarks (✓) showing they're resolved
Fix Implementation Details:

For each vulnerability found in the "Before" page, there's a corresponding fix explanation:
"✓ Reentrancy mitigated with noReentrant modifier"
"✓ External calls properly checked"
"✓ CEI pattern implemented correctly"
"✓ SafeMath used to prevent overflows"
Success Recommendation:

Includes a clear "Recommendation: Contract ready for deployment" message
Provides closure to the audit process
Success Summary Section:

Features a prominent
